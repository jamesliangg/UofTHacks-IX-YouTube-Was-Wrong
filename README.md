# UofTHacks IX YouTube Was Wrong

### What the application does?
Our application returns the functionality of YouTube took out not so long ago. We were able to ressurect the "dislike" button. With this We have restored the good old fashioned way of determining whether a YouTube was worth while watching (like/dislike ratio). We were able to restore the YouTube search to its former glory.
#

### Why we used the technologies you used?
With this project we were able to impliment Google's own YouTube API responsible for pulling the data (views, likes, dislikes, and video name). 
#

### Some of the challenges faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
Some challenges include working with an API for our first time. Making it very difficult for us to learn on the spot. We also did encounter some difficulty learning about sorting 2d arrays, as we haven't really learned this yet.
#

## Installation
Install Java, have a internet connection, and get a Google API Key. 
#

## Usage
Type your search into the console. Then input the Google API Key. Then tadah your results sorted by the likes/dislikes ratio.
